# PSI-MCMC-project
Project assignment for MCMC Week, PSI Numerical Methods 2023

For this assignment, we will look at the efficiency (convergence speed) for four different MCMC approaches:
* plain old Metropolis-Hastings with (uncorrelated) Gaussian jumps, and bad step sizes
* Metropolis-Hastings with (uncorrelated) Gaussian jumps, and good step sizes
* Metropolis-Hastings with correlated Gaussian jumps
* the Affine-invariant ensemble sampler

To start, please
* On the Github site, please *fork* this repository (hit the `Fork` button on the top-right of this page)
* Once Github has forked it (created a copy of this repository for you), under the `Code` button, copy the SSH URL
* On Symmetry, log in to Jupyterhub, then
* Start a `Terminal` session, and then type `git clone ` + paste the SSH URL
* In the Jupyterhub file browser on the left-hand side, find and open the `PSI-MCMC-project` directory, and then open the `Project.ipynb` notebook

As you work, you may want to save and *commit* your work so you don't lose anything!
* In Jupyterhub, hit the *save* button (or go to the *File* menu to *Save*)
* In a `Terminal` session, `cd PSI-MCMC-project` and then `git commit -a -m "helpful message"`.

When you are done, you will "hand in" your assignment like before, by completing a *survey* on the PSI Portal, giving the URL of your Github repository.
